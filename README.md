# Breezy Tailwind

## A React UI library written with tailwindcss (includes Tailwind UI components) that can easily be extended inline with tailwindcss


### Why?
#### Because I got tired of using the stuff that the Tailwind website has and wanted to easily centralize and import those components for personal projects
